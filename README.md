# Wizard-Wars
This is the final project for my Intro to Programming class from a few years ago. I can't recommend learning from the code, but it's here anyway.

## Getting Started
To run this program, navigate to the Release folder and run the executable file there. This is meant for Windows only, so it will not run on other operating systems.

## Compiling
If you want to compile the code yourself, it is located in the "cpsc146 project" folder. You will need the Allegro library to compile it. If you are using Visual Studio, I recommend using the NuGet Package Manager and running the command below. This will install the library for you and is much easier than dealing with it manually.

```
Install-Package Allegro
```

## Built With

* [Allegro](https://www.allegro.cc/) - The graphics library used


## Authors

* **[Wesley Paglia](https://github.com/wrp1002)** - *Initial work*
